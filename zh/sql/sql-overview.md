SQL Overview
============

SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a database management system. A standard for the specification of SQL is maintained by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Also, there are many variants and extensions to SQL to express more specific programs.

The [SQL grammar of HStreamDB](https://github.com/hstreamdb/hstream/blob/main/hstream-sql/etc/SQL.cf) is based on a subset of SQL-92 with some extensions to support stream operations.

## Syntax

SQL inputs are made up of a series of statements. Each statement is made up of a series of tokens and ends in a semicolon (`;`).

A token can be a keyword argument, an identifier, a literal, an operator, or a special character. The details of the rules can be found in the [BNFC grammar file](https://github.com/hstreamdb/hstream/blob/main/hstream-sql/etc/SQL.cf). Normally, tokens are separated by whitespace.

The following examples are syntactically valid SQL statements:

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_stream;

CREATE STREAM abnormal_weather AS SELECT * FROM weather WHERE temperature > 30 AND humidity > 80 WITH (REPLICATE = 3);

INSERT INTO weather (cityId, temperature, humidity) VALUES (11254469, 12, 65);
```

## Keywords

Some tokens such as `SELECT`, `INSERT` and `WHERE` are reserved *keywords*, which have specific meanings in SQL syntax. Keywords are case insensitive, which means that `SELECT` and `select` are equivalent. A keyword can not be used as an identifier.

For a complete list of keywords, see the [appendix](appendix.md).

## Identifiers

Identifiers are tokens that represent user-defined objects such as streams, fields, and other ones. For example, `my_stream` can be used as a stream name, and `temperature` can represent a field in the stream.

By now, identifiers only support C-style naming rules. It means that an identifier name can only have letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits, and the underscore. Besides, the first letter of an identifier should be either a letter or an underscore.

By now, identifiers are case sensitive, which means that `my_stream` and `MY_STREAM` are different identifiers.

## Literals (Constants)

Literals are objects with known values before being executed. There are six types of constants: integers, floats, strings, dates, time, and intervals so far.

### Integers

Integers are in the form of `digits`, where `digits` are one or more single-digit integers (0 through 9). Negatives such as `-1` are also supported. **Note that scientific notation is not supported yet**.

### Floats

Floats are in the form of `digits . digits`. Negative floats such as `-11.514` are supported.
Note that

- **scientific notation is not supported yet**.
- **Forms such as `1.` and `.99` are not supported yet**.

### Strings

Strings are arbitrary character series surrounded by double quotes (`"`), such as `"JSON"`.

### Dates

Dates represent a date exact to a day in the form of `DATE <year>-<month>-<day>`, where `<year>`, `<month>` and `<day>` are all integer constants. Note that the leading `DATE` should not be omitted.

Example: `DATE 2021-01-02`

### Time

Time constants represent time exact to a second in the form of `TIME <hour>-<minute>-<second>`, where `<hour>`, `<minute>` and `<second>` are all integer constants. Note that the leading `TIME` should not be omitted.

Example: `TIME 11:45:14`

### Intervals

Intervals represent a time section in the form of `INTERVAL <num> <time_unit>`, where `<num>` is an integer constant and `<time_unit>` is one of `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `WEEK`, `DAY`, `MINUTE` and `SECOND`. Note that the leading `INTERVAL` should not be omitted.

Example: `INTERVAL 5 SECOND`

## Operators and Functions

Functions are special keywords that mean some computation, such as `SUM` and `MIN`. And operators are infix functions composed of special characters, such as `>=` and `<>`.

For a complete list of functions and operators, see the [appendix](appendix.md).

## Special characters

There are some special characters in the SQL syntax with particular meanings:

- Parentheses (`()`) are used outside an expression for controlling the order of evaluation or specifying a function application.
- Brackets (`[]`) are used with maps and arrays for accessing their substructures, such as `some_map[temp]` and `some_array[1]`. **Note that it is not supported yet**.
- Commas (`,`) are used for delineating a list of objects.
- The semicolons (`;`) represent the end of a SQL statement.
- The asterisk (`*`) represents "all fields", such as `SELECT * FROM  my_stream;`.
- The period (`.`) is used for accessing a field in a stream, such as `my_stream.humidity`.

## Comments

A single-line comment begins with `//`:

```
// This is a comment
```

Also, C-style multi-line comments are supported:

```
/* This is another
   comment
*/
```
