# Create and Manage Subscriptions

## Attributes of a Subscription

- ackTimeoutSeconds.

  Specifies the max amount of time for the server to mark the record as
  unacknowledged, after which the record will be sent again.

- maxUnackedRecords.

  The maximum amount of unacknowledged records allowed. After exceeding the size
  set, the server will stop sending records to corresponding consumers.

## Create a subscription

Every subscription has to specify which stream to subscribe to, which means you
have to make sure the stream to be subscribed has already been created.

For the subscription name, please refer to the [guidelines to name a resource](./stream.md/#guidelines-to-name-a-resource)

When creating a subscription, you can provide the attributes mentioned like
this:

:::: tabs

::: tab Java

```java
// CreateSubscriptionExample.java
```

::: tab Go

```go
// ExampleCreateSubscription.go
```

::: tab Python3

## Delete a subscription

To delete a subscription without the force flag, you need to make sure that
there is no active subscription consumer.

### Delete a subscription with the force flag

If you do want to delete a subscription with running consumers, enable force
deletion. While force deleting a subscription, the subscription will be in
deleting state and closing running consumers, which means you will not be able
to join, delete or create a subscription with the same name. After the deletion
completes, you can create a subscription with the same name. However, this new
subscription will be a brand new subscription. Even if they subscribe to the
same stream, this new subscription will not share the consumption progress with
the deleted subscription.
